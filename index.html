    <h2>Education</h2>

    My name is Gergo Nemeth. I came from Hungary, and I was educated there as well.
    In order to gain access to RGU, I completed an IB course, in the last two years of my studies at a bilangual high school.
    Therefore, I have a certificate in high level English as well.
    Currently, I am learning Computer Graphics and Animation, about which I am very fond of.

    <h2>Work experience</h2>

    Considering the tight time schedule that my school and afternoon duties caused, I roughly had time for work,
    yet, I used to spend my occasional free time as a portrait artist at certain events.
    Apart from that, I`ve spent my last summer as a postman in Hungary, before coming to Scotland.

    <h2>Other activities</h2>

    while intending to work in the computer industry, which would require artisic skills and creativiy,
    I was constantly developing my skills in this field whenever I had the time.
    Currently, I am creating an animation series, along with a brand new comic, which enabled me to
    learn new skills and perspectives in these areas, which will hopefully come in handy in my new job.
